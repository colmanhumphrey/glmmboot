Title: Bootstrap Resampling for Mixed Effects and Plain Models
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: person("Colman", "Humphrey", email = "humphrc@tcd.ie",
  role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Performs bootstrap resampling for most models that update() works for. There
    are two main functions: BootGlmm() performs block resampling if random effects
    are present, and case resampling if not; BootCI() converts output from
    bootstrap model runs into confidence intervals and p-values. By default,
    BootGlmm() calls BootCI(). 
    Package motivated by Humphrey and Swingley (2018) <arXiv:1805.08670>.
